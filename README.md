# UFOs

## Overview
### Dana's webpage could be upgraded for users to have more tools while searching for data. We will help her by adding 5 different filters for users to navigate through the data better. This will allow a more in-depth analysis with the option of multiple criteria at the same time.

## Results

### The webpage that we created has a clean and organized design that will allow users to navigate easily through the data. 

### Users are able to filter the data with the following criteria: Date, City, State, Country, Shape.

### This webpage will allow users to analyze data an create different types of reports.

## Summary

### - We made great progress in the webpage but there is always room for improvement. Only lower case letters are working in the search bar and this will affect most users. We will have to check the code to resolve this issue for a smoother navigation on the webpage.

### - When you filter for any criteria that can't be found in the data, you need to reload the webpage again to restart the search. We will need to debug this issue to avoid people from restarting the whole search and loose data they are currently checking.
